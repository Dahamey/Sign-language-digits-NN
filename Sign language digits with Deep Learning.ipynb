    "* Now that we understand our cost, which is the error, therefore, we need to decrease the cost because a high cost indicates that we made the wrong prediction.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* To decrease the cost, we need to update the weights and biases, in other words, our model needs to learn the parameters (weights and biases) that minimize the cost function. This technique is called **gradient descent**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose we have $w = 5$ and bias $= 0$ (ignore bias for now). Then, after forward propagation, our cost function is $1.5$.\n",

    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://imgbb.com/\"><img src=\"http://image.ibb.co/dAaYJH/7.jpg\" alt=\"7\" border=\"0\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "* As seen from the graph, we are not at the minimum point of the cost function. Therefore, we need to move towards the minimum cost. Ok, let's update the weight. (The symbol $:=$ denotes updating)\n",
    "* $w := w - \\text{step}$. The question is, what is this step? The step is the slope1. Ok, it seems remarkable. To find the minimum point, we can use slope1. Let's say slope1 $= 3$ and update our weight. $w := w - \\text{slope1} \\Rightarrow w = 2$.\n",
    "* Now, our weight $w$ is $2$. As you remember, we need to find the cost function with forward propagation again.\n",
    "* Let's say, according to forward propagation with $w = 2$, the cost function is $0.4$. Hmm, we are heading in the right direction because our cost function is decreasing. We have a new value for the cost function, which is $0.4$. Is that enough? Actually, I do not know; let's try one more step.\n",
    "* Slope2 $= 0.7$ and $w = 2$. Let's update the weight: $w := w - \\text{step}(\\text{slope2}) \\Rightarrow w = 1.3$, which is the new weight. So, let's find the new cost.\n",
    "* Perform one more forward propagation with $w = 1.3$, and our cost $= 0.3$. Ok, our cost even decreased. It looks fine, but is it enough, or do we need to take one more step? The answer is, again, I do not know; let's try.\n",
    "* Slope3 $= 0.01$ and $w = 1.3$. Updating weight: $w := w - \\text{step}(\\text{slope3}) \\Rightarrow w = 1.29 \\approx 1.3$. The weight does not change because we found the minimum point of the cost function.\n",
    "Everything seems good, but how do we find the slope? If you remember from high school or university, to find the slope of a function (cost function) at a given point (at a given weight), we take the derivative of the function at the given point. You may ask, how does it know where to go? You can say that it can go to higher cost values instead of going to the minimum point. The answer is that the slope (derivative) gives both the step and the direction of the step. Therefore, do not worry :)\n",
    "* The update equation is this. It says that there is a cost function (which takes weight and bias). Take the derivative of the cost function according to weight and bias. Then multiply it by $\\alpha$, the learning rate. Then update the weight. (In order to explain, I ignore bias, but all these steps will be applied to bias as well)\n",

    "\n",
    "* Now, I'm sure you are asking, what is the **learning rate** that I mentioned earlier? It is a very simple term that determines the learning rate. However, there is a tradeoff between learning fast and never learning. For example, you are in Paris (current cost) and want to go to Madrid (minimum cost). If your speed (learning rate) is small, you can go to Madrid very slowly, and it takes too long. On the other hand, if your speed (learning rate) is big, you can go very fast, but maybe you crash and never get to Madrid. Therefore, we need to choose our speed (learning rate) wisely.\n",
    "* The learning rate is also called a hyperparameter that needs to be chosen and tuned. I will explain it more in detail in artificial neural networks with other hyperparameters. For now, just assume the learning rate is $1$ for our previous example.\n",
    "* I think now you understand the logic behind **forward propagation (from weights and bias to cost)** and **backward propagation (from cost to weights and bias to update them)**. Also, you learned about gradient descent. Before implementing the code, you need to learn one more thing: how to take the derivative of the cost function according to weights and bias. It is not related to Python or coding; it is pure mathematics. There are two options: the first one is to google how to take the derivative of the log loss function, and the second one is even to google what the derivative of the log loss function is :) I choose the second one because I cannot explain math without talking.\n",

    "\"'Deep' is a relative term, it of course refers to the 'depth' of a network, meaning how many hidden layers it has. 'How deep is your swimming pool?' could be 12 feet or it might be 2 feet; nevertheless, it still has a depth--it has the quality of 'deepness'. 32 years ago, people used two or three hidden layers. That was the limit for the specialized hardware of the day. Just a few years ago, 20 layers was considered pretty deep. In October, Andrew Ng mentioned 152 layers was (one of) the biggest commercial networks he knew of. Last week, I talked to someone at a big, famous company who said he was using 'thousands'. So I prefer to just stick with 'How deep?'\"\n",
