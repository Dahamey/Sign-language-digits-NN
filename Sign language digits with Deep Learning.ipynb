Let's learn what is a loss(error) function\n* Let's take an example, I've put one image as input then multiply it with their weights and add bias term to have $z$. Then put $z$ into sigmoid method to find $y_{head}$. Up to this point we know what we did. Then e.g $y_{head}$ became 0.9 that is bigger than 0.5 so our prediction of the image is a sign \"one\" image. Ok, every thing looks fine. But, is our prediction correct ? and how do we check whether it is correct or not? The answer is we do it using the  **loss(error) function**:\n    * Mathematical expression of log loss(error) function is that: \n    <a href=\"https://imgbb.com/\"><img src=\"https://image.ibb.co/eC0JCK/duzeltme.jpg\" alt=\"duzeltme\" border=\"0\"></a>\n    * It says that if you make wrong prediction, loss(error) becomes big. **DENKLEM DUZELTME**\n        * Example: Our real image is labeled as \"sign one\" with the label $y = 1$. Upon making a prediction, let's say $y_{\\text{head}} = 1$. When we substitute $y$ and $y_{\\text{head}}$ into the loss (error) equation, the result is 0. This indicates a correct prediction, hence our loss is 0. However, if we were to make an incorrect prediction, such as $y_{\\text{head}} = 0$, the loss (error) becomes infinity.\n\n* Following this, the cost function is the summation of the loss function. Each image contributes to the loss function. Therefore, the cost function is the summation of the loss functions generated by each input image.\n\n* Now, let's proceed to implement forward propagation.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Forward propagation steps :\n# 1/ Find z = w^T * X ° b\n# 2/ y_head = sigmoid(z)\n# 3/ loss(error) = loss(y, y_head)\n# 4/ cost = sum(loss)\n\ndef forward_propagation(w, b, X_train, y_train):\n    z = w.T @ X_train + b   # shape(1,349)\n    y_head = sigmoid(z)    # shape(1,349)\n    loss = -(1-y_train) * np.log(1-y_head) - y_train*np.log(y_head)  # shape(1,349)\n    cost = loss.sum() / X_train.shape[1]   # for scaling\n    return cost","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"7\"></a> <br>\n##  Optimization Algorithm with Gradient Descent\n\n* Now that we understand our cost, which is the error, therefore, we need to decrease the cost because a high cost indicates that we made the wrong prediction.\n\n* Let's consider the **first step**: everything starts with initializing weights and biases. Therefore, the cost depends on them.\n\n* To decrease the cost, we need to update the weights and biases, in other words, our model needs to learn the parameters (weights and biases) that minimize the cost function. This technique is called **gradient descent**.\n\n* Let's illustrate this with an example:\n\nSuppose we have $w = 5$ and bias $= 0$ (ignore bias for now). Then, after forward propagation, our cost function is $1.5$.\nIt looks like this: (red lines)\n\n<a href=\"http://imgbb.com/\"><img src=\"http://image.ibb.co/dAaYJH/7.jpg\" alt=\"7\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n* As seen from the graph, we are not at the minimum point of the cost function. Therefore, we need to move towards the minimum cost. Ok, let's update the weight. (The symbol $:=$ denotes updating)\n* $w := w - \\text{step}$. The question is, what is this step? The step is the slope1. Ok, it seems remarkable. To find the minimum point, we can use slope1. Let's say slope1 $= 3$ and update our weight. $w := w - \\text{slope1} \\Rightarrow w = 2$.\n* Now, our weight $w$ is $2$. As you remember, we need to find the cost function with forward propagation again.\n* Let's say, according to forward propagation with $w = 2$, the cost function is $0.4$. Hmm, we are heading in the right direction because our cost function is decreasing. We have a new value for the cost function, which is $0.4$. Is that enough? Actually, I do not know; let's try one more step.\n* Slope2 $= 0.7$ and $w = 2$. Let's update the weight: $w := w - \\text{step}(\\text{slope2}) \\Rightarrow w = 1.3$, which is the new weight. So, let's find the new cost.\n* Perform one more forward propagation with $w = 1.3$, and our cost $= 0.3$. Ok, our cost even decreased. It looks fine, but is it enough, or do we need to take one more step? The answer is, again, I do not know; let's try.\n* Slope3 $= 0.01$ and $w = 1.3$. Updating weight: $w := w - \\text{step}(\\text{slope3}) \\Rightarrow w = 1.29 \\approx 1.3$. The weight does not change because we found the minimum point of the cost function.\nEverything seems good, but how do we find the slope? If you remember from high school or university, to find the slope of a function (cost function) at a given point (at a given weight), we take the derivative of the function at the given point. You may ask, how does it know where to go? You can say that it can go to higher cost values instead of going to the minimum point. The answer is that the slope (derivative) gives both the step and the direction of the step. Therefore, do not worry :)\n* The update equation is this. It says that there is a cost function (which takes weight and bias). Take the derivative of the cost function according to weight and bias. Then multiply it by $\\alpha$, the learning rate. Then update the weight. (In order to explain, I ignore bias, but all these steps will be applied to bias as well)\n\n<a href=\"http://imgbb.com/\"><img src=\"http://image.ibb.co/hYTTJH/8.jpg\" alt=\"8\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n\n* Now, I'm sure you are asking, what is the **learning rate** that I mentioned earlier? It is a very simple term that determines the learning rate. However, there is a tradeoff between learning fast and never learning. For example, you are in Paris (current cost) and want to go to Madrid (minimum cost). If your speed (learning rate) is small, you can go to Madrid very slowly, and it takes too long. On the other hand, if your speed (learning rate) is big, you can go very fast, but maybe you crash and never get to Madrid. Therefore, we need to choose our speed (learning rate) wisely.\n* The learning rate is also called a hyperparameter that needs to be chosen and tuned. I will explain it more in detail in artificial neural networks with other hyperparameters. For now, just assume the learning rate is $1$ for our previous example.\n* I think now you understand the logic behind **forward propagation (from weights and bias to cost)** and **backward propagation (from cost to weights and bias to update them)**. Also, you learned about gradient descent. Before implementing the code, you need to learn one more thing: how to take the derivative of the cost function according to weights and bias. It is not related to Python or coding; it is pure mathematics. There are two options: the first one is to google how to take the derivative of the log loss function, and the second one is even to google what the derivative of the log loss function is :) I choose the second one because I cannot explain math without talking.\n\n$$ \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial w} = \\frac{1}{m}x(  y_head - y)^T$$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial b} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m (y_head-y)$$","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# In backward propagation we will use y_head that we found in forward progation\n# Therefore instead of writing backward propagation method, lets combine forward propagation and backward propagation\n\n\ndef forward_backward_propagation(w,b,X_train,y_train):\n    \n    # forward propagation\n    z = w.T @ X_train + b\n    y_head = sigmoid(z)\n    loss = -y_train*np.log(y_head)-(1-y_train)*np.log(1-y_head)\n    cost = (np.sum(loss))/X_train.shape[1]      # for scaling\n    \n    # backward propagation\n    derivative_weight = (X_train @ ((y_head-y_train).T)) / X_train.shape[1] \n    derivative_bias = np.sum(y_head-y_train) / X_train.shape[1]\n    \n    # Dictionary of weights and biases derivatives\n    gradients = {\"derivative_weight\": derivative_weight,\"derivative_bias\": derivative_bias}\n    return cost,gradients","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Up to this point, we have learned:\n\n* Initializing the parameters (implemented)\n* Finding the cost with forward propagation and cost function (implemented)\n* Updating (learning) parameters (weight and bias).

However, in a neural network, there is at least one hidden layer between the input and output layers.\n\n**What is deep, in order to say \"deep\", and how many layers do I need to have?**\n\"'Deep' is a relative term, it of course refers to the 'depth' of a network, meaning how many hidden layers it has. 'How deep is your swimming pool?' could be 12 feet or it might be 2 feet; nevertheless, it still has a depth--it has the quality of 'deepness'. 32 years ago, people used two or three hidden layers. That was the limit for the specialized hardware of the day. Just a few years ago, 20 layers was considered pretty deep. In October, Andrew Ng mentioned 152 layers was (one of) the biggest commercial networks he knew of. Last week, I talked to someone at a big, famous company who said he was using 'thousands'. So I prefer to just stick with 'How deep?'\"\n**Why is it called hidden ?**\nBecause the hidden layer does not see the inputs (training set).\nFor example, if you have input, one hidden, and output layers, when someone asks you \"hey, my friend, how many layers does your neural network have?\" The answer is \"I have a 2-layer neural network\". Because **while computing the layer number, the input layer is ignored**.\nLet's see a 2-layer neural network:\n<a href=\"http://ibb.co/eF315x\"><img src=\"http://preview.ibb.co/dajVyH/9.jpg\" alt=\"9\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\nStep by step, we will learn about this image:\n\n* As you can see, there is one hidden layer between the input and output layers, and this hidden layer has 3 nodes. If you're curious why I chose the number of nodes as 3, the answer is there is no reason, I just chose it that way :). The number of nodes is a hyperparameter like the learning rate. Therefore, we will discuss hyperparameters at the end of artificial neural networks.\n\n* Input and output layers do not change. They are the same as logistic regression.\n\n* In the image, there is a $tanh$ function, it is an activation function like the sigmoid function. **The $tanh$ activation function is better than sigmoid for hidden units because the mean of its output is closer to zero, so it centers the data better for the next layer**. Also, the $tanh$ activation function increases non-linearity, which helps our model learn better.\n\n* As you can see, with the purple color, there are two parts. Both parts are like logistic regression. The only difference is the activation function, inputs, and outputs.\n    * **In logistic regression: input => output**\n    * **In a 2-layer neural network: input => hidden layer => output**. You can think of the hidden layer as the output of part 1 and the input of part 2.\n    \n* That's all. We will follow the same path as logistic regression for the 2-layer neural network.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-03-30T18:17:52.828726Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-03-30T18:17:52.829641Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-03-30T18:17:52.837540Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-03-30T18:17:52.829603Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-03-30T18:17:52.836426Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"11\"></a> <br>\n## 2-Layer Neural Network\n\n* 1/ Size of layers and initializing parameters weights and bias\n* 2/ Forward propagation\n* 3/ Loss function and Cost function\n* 4/ Backward propagation\n* 5/ Update Parameters\n* 6/ Prediction with learnt parameters weight and bias\n* 7/ Create Model","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"12\"></a> <br>\n## 2-1) Size of layers and initializing parameters weights and bias\n\n* For `X_train` that has 349 samples (349 images, 1 image per column) $x^{(349)}$:\n$$z^{[1] (349)} =  W^{[1]} x^{(349)} + b^{[1] (349)}$$ \n$$a^{[1] (349)} = \\tanh(z^{[1] (349)})$$\n$$z^{[2] (349)} = W^{[2]} a^{[1] (349)} + b^{[2] (349)}$$\n$$\\hat{y}^{(349)} = a^{[2] (349)} = \\sigma(z^{ [2] (349)})$$\n\n* In logistic regression, we initialized weights to 0.01 and bias to 0.

Therefore, even after multiple iterations of gradient descent, each neuron in the layer will compute the same thing as the other neurons. Thus, we initialize them randomly. Additionally, initial weights should be small. If they are very large initially, this will cause the inputs of the tanh function to be very large, resulting in gradients close to zero (vanishing gradient).
